Activity 1:
	1. When Rotary switch 1, 2, 3, and 4 are normally open, it passes power to motor 1 which turs on. As for
	the control circuit which uses a binary data value it is set at 1 (on) when all rotary switches are open
	and power is flowing through the system.
	2. When the red push button is press, it sets the binary data value to 0 (off) which shuts the power to motor 1. 
	I am assuming the red push button acts like an e-stop button (emergency button).

Activity 2:
	1. When rotary switch 3 is close, the red pilot light and control relay 1 are engergized.
	2. When rotary switch 2 and 3 are close, the red pilot light is engergized.
	3. When all rotary switches are close, the red pilot light is on.
	4. When all rotary switches are close and the push-button is activated, the red pilot light and the buzzer are on.
	5. If all rotary switches are open, it activates the red pilot light and control relay 1 and 2 are engergized.
	6. When rotary switch 3 is closedand the push-button is activated, it will turn on motor 1 and the buzzer.

Activity 3:
	Once the red push botton is activated (NO) and both green and yellow push buttons are (NC), motor one and two will 
	turn on but once rotary switch one is activated then it will disable motor one and two and trigger the control relay.
	When the red push button is stopped (NC) it willshut down the system.
