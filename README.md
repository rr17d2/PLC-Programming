# PLC-Programming
RSLogix 500, Simulator TLP LogixPro

PLC programs written in SLC 500 series: RSLogix 500 and TLP LogixPro Simulator. These programs were created during a course I took for an Industrial Automation certificate. Programs range from basic PLC concepts such as Input/Output devices and Motor Controls in parallel and series circuits to Sequencer Instructions.  

- week_2 = **converting relay logic to ladder logic
- week_3 = **converting relay logic to ladder logic
- week_4 = **converting relay logic to ladder logic
- week_5 = **converting relay logic to ladder logic using Latch and Unlatch
- week_6 = **operational description (control narrative)
- week_7 = **Logic Gates, Jog, and Run Mode
- week_9 = **Time Timers and Cascaded Timers as Oscillator
- week_10 = **Time Timers with Counters
- week_11 = **Math and Compare Instructions
- week_12 = **Master Control Reset (MCR), Jump, and Subroutine Instructions
- week_13 = **Bit Shift Right and Bit Shift Left Instructions
- week_14 = **Sequencer Output Instruction (SQO)
