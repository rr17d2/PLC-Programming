# PLC-Programming
RSLogix 500, Simulator TLP LogixPro

PLC programs written in SLC 500 series: RSLogix 500 and TLP LogixPro Simulator. These programs were created during a course I took for an Industrial Automation certificate. Programs range from basic PLC concepts such as Input/Output devices and Motor Controls in parallel and series circuits to Sequencer Instructions.  

1. week_2 = converting relay logic to ladder logic
2. week_3 = converting relay logic to ladder logic
3. week_4 = converting relay logic to ladder logic
4. week_5 = converting relay logic to ladder logic using Latch and Unlatch
5. week_6 = operational description (control narrative)
6. week_7 = Logic Gates, Jog, and Run Mode
7. week_9 = Time Timers and Cascaded Timers as Oscillator
8. week_10 = Time Timers with Counters
9. week_11 = Math and Compare Instructions
10. week_12 = Master Control Reset (MCR), Jump, and Subroutine Instructions
11. week_13 = Bit Shift Right and Bit Shift Left Instructions
12. week_14 = Sequencer Output Instruction (SQO)
